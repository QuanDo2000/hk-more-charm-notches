# HK More Charm Notches

A Hollow Knight mod that doubles the number of charm notches you have, so that you start wih 6 instead of 3, and every additional charm notch item you find will give you an extra 2 notches.

I've found that being able to equip more charms makes the late game easier for those (like me 😬) who fall behind the difficulty curve, but preserves the intended experience in the early game, and still rewards exploration. It's like an Easy Mode but you don't have to cheat the game and yourself! Not _that_ much, anyways.

## FAQ

### Can I still overcharm?

Yup, no change there, except that the limit is higher.

### What happens if I equip a bunch of charms and then disable or uninstall the mod?

The charms will stay equipped, but you can't add any more until you go back down below the new limit.

### Does it work with Randomizer?

Kind of, maybe? I haven't tested it. I expect that it will mostly work fine, except that the randomizer logic doesn't know about the increased charm notches, so it might assume that you can't equip a charm that you actually can.

## More ideas (let me know if you'd like them!)

* Customize how many additional notches you start with
* Customize how many notches you get per item
* Add more notch items to Salubra's shop
